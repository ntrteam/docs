# M3i Zero GMP-Z003

Not to be mistaken with the M3i Zero **non** GMP-Z003 model, this card is very
different from it's predecessor.

### Flash Memory

The `GMP-Z003` uses a `MX29LV160DBXEI-70G` for flash memory, it is a 2MB chip.
This device operates over a voltage range of 2.7V to 3.6V typically using a 3V
power supply input. The flash memory is read directly to the NDS as a cartridge,
the format of which can be found [here](http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#dsicartridgeheader).
It is writeable through the flashing process.

### Flashing

The device can be flashed by providing DC power to the `J3` port. I just stripped
a USB cable and put the positive and ground in. The FPGA searches
the SD card for `/F_CORE.DAT` and copies `0x200000 -> 0x400000` to the flash
memory chip. I believe the `F_CORE.DAT` needs to be signed in order for the
FPGA to copy it first however.

The LED light `D1` will change depending on the status of the flash:
* Nothing: No power or completed
* Static: Error reading `F_CORE.DAT` (SD card might not be inserted, etc..)
* Flashing: Copying `F_CORE.DAT` to the flash memory.

Alternatively the device can be flashed whilst inserted via the DS itself
using card commands.

### Card Commands

The reconstructed C source of that DLDI interface can be found here: [iointerface.c](gmpz003/dldi/iointerface.c)

* `B0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00` = Card Info (should be 0x5AA5)
* `C9 oo oo oo oo xx 00 00` = Read (FIFO read 0x200 words)
* `C5 oo oo oo oo xx 00 00` = Write (write 0x200 words)
* `C6 00 00 00 00 00 00 00` = get write status, read 1 word (= 0 when finished) 
* `CA 00 00 00 00 00 00 00` = get read status, read 1 word (= 0 when finished) 

Where `oooooo` is the offset in number of words(?), `MSB` first
Where `xx` represents the type in the DLDI interface this is set to `0x00` for SD card access.
* `0x00` : SD card access afaik.
* `0xE0`: "SW" header, used with `offset = 0`, after that `offset += 0x10000` (in number of words)
* `0xF0`: "SW" regular sector (0x200 bytes)
* `0xA0`: "HW" sector. One sector (header ?) is at 0x80000000 then the others start at offset 0.
